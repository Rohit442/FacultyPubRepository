# FacultyPubRepository
Faculty publication repository is a platform where faculties from a University can publish their Report . With the platform acting as middleware between Faculties reports and their users who will be willing to read the publication. The objective of this project is to design and develop a digital publication repository where the signed-in faculties can publish their reports . 

A signed-in faculty will be assigned a dashboard from which they can Create/Edit/Delete their Reports. Any end User who would want to Search/Read a Report can do so by searching the particular report by its name or the category it belongs. They facility is available in Home page available to users by default . With the help of this platform any signed-in user can mark his/her comments on the publication. 

When an end-user/Faculty encounter a problem in the platform they can report the bug via email/Whatsapp to SysAdmin . Faculty encountering common issues and having doubts on usage of Platform can search their query FAQ column present in Contact page. All Faculties/Students can know more about the privacy policy implemented by platform and its publication modes in the About Page.
